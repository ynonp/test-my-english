# Website Style Guide: "Uptick Professional"

This document outlines the design system for a clean, professional, and conversion-focused single-page website. The aesthetic is modern, minimalist, and trustworthy, aimed at a professional audience.

## 1. Color Palette

The color palette is simple and clean, creating a high-contrast, readable, and professional look.

*   **Primary Background:** White (`#FFFFFF`)
*   **Primary Text:** Near-Black / Dark Charcoal (`#212529`)
*   **Accent Color (for CTAs and Links):** A vibrant, trustworthy blue (`#007BFF`).
*   **Secondary Background (for alternating sections):** Light Gray (`#F8F9FA`) to create visual separation between content blocks.
*   **Success/Highlight Color:** A subtle green or secondary accent color could be used for highlighting success metrics or positive elements.

## 2. Typography

The typography is chosen for maximum readability and a modern, professional feel.

*   **Headings (h1, h2, h3):**
    *   **Font:** A clean, sans-serif font like **Montserrat**, **Poppins**, or **Lato**.
    *   **Weight:** Bold (700).
    *   **Style:** All caps or sentence case, depending on the level of heading. Main headlines should be impactful.
*   **Body Text:**
    *   **Font:** A highly readable sans-serif font like **Open Sans**, **Roboto**, or **Lato**.
    *   **Size:** 16px - 18px for optimal readability.
    *   **Weight:** Regular (400).
    *   **Line Height:** 1.5 - 1.7 for comfortable reading.

## 3. Main Elements & UI Components

### a. Overall Layout
*   A single-page, top-to-bottom scroll layout.
*   Generous use of white space to avoid a cluttered look.
*   The layout is divided into clear, full-width sections.

### b. Header & Navigation
*   **Sticky Header:** The header should remain visible at the top of the page on scroll.
*   **Logo:** Positioned on the left.
*   **Navigation Links:** Centered or on the right. Links should be simple: "Home," "Services," "Contact."
*   **Secondary CTA:** A less prominent link or button for a secondary action, like "Login" or "Free Guide."

### c. Hero Section
*   **Headline (h1):** Large, bold, and centered. It should state the core value proposition clearly. [1]
*   **Sub-headline:** Directly below the main headline, providing a brief explanation.
*   **Primary CTA Button:** A large, prominent button with the accent color. The text should be a clear call to action, such as "Schedule a Free Consultation >>". [1]

### d. Service/Program Sections
*   **Layout:** Use a two-column grid to display service tiers side-by-side for easy comparison.
*   **Content:** Each tier should have a clear title, a short description, and a distinct "Learn More >>" link. [1]

### e. Testimonials
*   **Layout:** Display testimonials in cards or as a slider.
*   **Content:** Each testimonial must include a quote, the person's full name, their professional title, and their company. [1] An image of the person is optional but adds credibility.
*   **Quote Style:** The quote text should be italicized or visually distinct from the attribution.

### f. Buttons & CTAs
*   **Primary Buttons:** Solid fill with the accent color (`#007BFF`), white text, and slightly rounded corners. Add a subtle hover effect (e.g., slight darkening or lightening).
*   **Secondary Links/Buttons:** Can be ghost buttons (outline only) or simple text links with an arrow (`>>`) to indicate action.

### g. Forms
*   **Style:** Clean and simple with clearly labeled fields.
*   **Fields:** White background, thin grey border, and rounded corners.
*   **Submit Button:** Should be a primary CTA button style.

### h. Footer
*   **Layout:** A multi-column layout.
*   **Content:** Include the company logo, main navigation links repeated, links to resources, and social media icons.
*   **Copyright:** A simple, centered line at the very bottom with copyright information and designer credits. [1]
